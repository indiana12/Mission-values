# Management Ops

Organize your systems for executing plans and leading teams.

- [[Life-Systems/05-Management/01-Productivity/README|Productivity Systems]] for daily rituals, OKRs, and sprint cadences.
- [[Life-Systems/05-Management/02-Leadership/README|Leadership Notes]] to capture 1:1s, coaching frameworks, and team development ideas.
- [[Life-Systems/05-Management/03-Operations/README|Operations Desk]] focused on process docs, SOPs, and tooling inventories.

Use the tag `#ops` for process notes to surface them in the graph alongside project work.
