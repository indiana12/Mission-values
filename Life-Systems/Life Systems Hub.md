## Graph Colour Setup
Assign a distinct colour to each `life/*` tag in Obsidian’s graph view:
1. Open **Graph View → Groups → + → Tags**.
2. Enter one tag (e.g., `life/fitness`) per group and choose a colour.
3. Repeat for `life/finance`, `life/ideas`, `life/coding`, `life/management`, and `life/hub`.

> Tip: Pin this hub so every domain stays one click away.
