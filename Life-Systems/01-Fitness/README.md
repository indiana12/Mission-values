# Fitness Systems

Focus this area on habits that sustain energy and resilience.

- [[Life-Systems/01-Fitness/01-Training/README|Training Plans]] for weekly programming, progress logs, and PR tracking.
- [[Life-Systems/01-Fitness/02-Nutrition/README|Nutrition Playbooks]] to store meal templates, macros, and shopping lists.
- [[Life-Systems/01-Fitness/03-Recovery/README|Recovery Routines]] covering sleep protocols, mobility, and stress resets.
- [[Life-Systems/01-Fitness/Fitness-Agent|Fitness Agent Blueprint]] to brief the coaching assistant on data inputs, workflows, and prompts.

When logging workouts, title notes `YYYY-MM-DD - Session` so they group chronologically.
