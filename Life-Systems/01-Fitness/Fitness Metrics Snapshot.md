This note captures the latest full-body assessment and current lifestyle protocols. Use it as the baseline when the fitness agent evaluates progress or recommends changes.

## Body Metrics
| Parameter | Current (Oct 2025) | Target (Apr 2026) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Height | 6’2½″ (189 cm) | — | Fixed |
| Weight | 102 kg | 90–92 kg | Target ~0.7 kg/week loss |
| Body Fat % | 19 % | 13 % | Requires consistent deficit |
| Visceral Fat | 9 | ≤ 5 | Prioritize anti-inflammatory habits |
| Skeletal Muscle Mass | 48.4 kg | 49–50 kg | Preserve via protein + strength |

| Post-Swim Snack | Whey + fruit (kiwi/apple) + almonds/peanut butter | Recovery plus fat oxidation |
| Dinner (Light) | 150 g paneer/eggs + sautéed veggies + olive oil | Night protein + fiber for metabolism |
| Hydration & Supps | 4.5 L water, ZMA + Omega-3 + Ashwagandha at night | Recovery, cortisol control |
