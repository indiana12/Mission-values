# 2025-11-11 Swim Session Plan

## Session Intent
- Technique + aerobic flush in cooler water.
- Emphasis on bilateral breathing rhythm, hip-driven kick, and keeping stroke count steady despite winter stiffness.

## Logged Session
- Warm-up: 200 m easy + mobility.
- Main work:
  - 10 × 25 m freestyle (focus on rhythm; observed issues with hand recovery and hip-driven kick). Rest ~20 s.
  - 8 × 50 m snorkel drills with fins (breathing rhythm, body alignment).
- Cool-down: 100 m easy scull + shoulder mobility.

## Metrics & Observations
- Water temperature: cool winter pool; RPE ~6.
- Stroke count: fluctuated (taller frame causing elongated glide but inconsistent).
- Rhythm issue: hand recovery stiff, rotation timing off.
- Kick feedback: external observers noted kick starting from knees, not hips; lacking hip drive.

## Post-Swim Recovery
- Warm shower + contrast breathing (box breathing 3 min).
- Light dinner (30–40 g protein, veggies, healthy fat).

## Superman Notes
- Issues to address: hand recovery softness, hip-driven kick, maintain stroke count within ±1.
- Superman Response:
  - **Drill Block A (Hip Drive)**: 6×25 m side-kick with fins, hands at side, focus on small hip-led kicks; add snorkel to remove breathing load.
  - **Drill Block B (Tall-Frame Rhythm)**: 4×50 m catch-up freestyle with soft hand entry, count “1-2” before pull; keep elbow high.
  - **Drill Block C (Hand Recovery)**: 4×25 m fingertip drag drill to force relaxed recovery and shoulder rotation.
  - **Cue**: Imagine “zipper up the side” during recovery; kick originates from glutes/hips, knees only follow.
  - **Homework**: Record stroke count for each drill, note when hip drive clicks; update Swimming Focus before next swim.

    - Tall-frame catch-up drill — search `Swim Smooth catch up drill tall swimmers`.
    - Fingertip/zipper drill — search `Fingertip drag drill freestyle recovery`.
  - **Comparison Note**: Morning push volume loads shoulders/chest; treat afternoon swim as technique restoration—relaxed recovery offsets pressing fatigue, hip drive compensates for heavy upper-body work.
