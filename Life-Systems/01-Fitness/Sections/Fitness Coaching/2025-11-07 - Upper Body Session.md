- Response paste:
  - Focus: balance scap loading by opening next session with heavy vertical pulls before pressing.
  - Recovery: post-workout protein 40 g + electrolytes; 10 min thoracic/lat stretch tonight.
  - Swim today stays technique-only (RPE ≤5). Log breathing drill results in Swimming Focus.
