# Jarvis Idea Agent

[[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/Ideas|← Ideas]]

## Mission
Generate, refine, and prioritise daily ideas that are feasible, scalable, and worth personal investment.

## Inputs Jarvis Consumes
- Recent captures in `Ideas - Capture Log`, tagged `#spark` or `#opportunity`.
- Research summaries inside the Ideas folder, especially notes marked with `#insight`.
- Business, tech, or trend notes stored elsewhere in the vault and tagged `#market`, `#tech`, or `#strategy`.
- Constraint tags such as `#low-budget`, `#no-code`, or `#available-weekend` to tailor output.

## Core Workflows
1. **Daily Idea Sprint** – Review the latest captures, combine at least two signals, and produce 3–5 concepts ranked by feasibility, scalability, and excitement.
2. **Feasibility Filter** – Stress-test a concept by listing success conditions, resource needs, and earliest validation steps.
3. **Scalable Angle** – Suggest leverage points (automation, partnerships, licensing) that expand the upside.
4. **Next-Step Blueprint** – Output a 1–2 step experiment plan with success metrics and a follow-up reminder.

## Daily Journal Routine
1. Duplicate either the [[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/Journal/Jarvis Idea Journal Template|Idea Journal Template]] for captures or the [[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/Journal/Jarvis Daily Idea Template|Jarvis Daily Idea Template]] for daily business concepts.
2. Fill the **Observations & Sparks** section with raw notes from the field.
3. Prompt Jarvis: “Jarvis, run the Daily Idea Sprint using today’s observations (paste bullet list).”
4. Paste Jarvis’s response into **Jarvis Synthesis**, editing for clarity.
5. Capture follow-up tasks in **Notes to Future Me** and add reminders in your task system if needed.

## Prompt Starters
- “Jarvis, generate four fresh concepts using yesterday’s `Ideas - Capture Log` entries tagged `#spark`.”
- “Jarvis, pressure-test the note `Idea - Community Skill Exchange` for feasibility and offer the quickest validation experiment.”
- “Jarvis, remix `#ai` and `#creator-economy` signals into three scalable product ideas.”

## Output Standards
- Lead with the highest-potential idea; include a feasibility score (1–5), scalability angle, and first experiment.
- Reference source notes with Obsidian wiki links.
- Flag missing context before recommending action (e.g., “Need target audience definition.”).

## Maintenance
- Refresh prompts monthly with what worked.
- Archive stale ideas into a “Dormant” section to keep Jarvis focused on current opportunities.
