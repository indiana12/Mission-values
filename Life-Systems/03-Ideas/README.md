# Idea Studio

Use this zone to capture sparks, research, and experiments before they become projects.

- [[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/01-Idea-Bank/README|Idea Bank]] holds raw prompts and questions—triage weekly.
- [[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/02-Research/README|Research Lab]] for deep dives, references, and annotated sources.
- [[Life-Systems/03-Ideas/03-Experiments/README|Experiment Log]] to design hypotheses and document outcomes.

Prefix idea titles with `Idea -` so backlinks stay readable in the Obsidian graph.
