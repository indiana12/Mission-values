# Budget Plan — November 2025

Inputs: Budget Analysis dated 11 Nov 2025 (income ₹2.03L, spend ₹1.48L, net savings 27%).

## Target Caps (Mid-Month Plan)
| Bucket | Current Spend | Cap | Remaining | Instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Needs & Essentials (45%) | ₹94,800 | ₹91,369 | -₹3,431 | Essentials-only for rest of month; no supplement buys without approval. |
| Goals & Obligations (30%) | ₹54,000 | ₹60,912 | +₹6,912 | Keep transfers stable but prepare to trim ₹10k next income. |
| Lifestyle & Joy (20%) | ₹45,000 | ₹40,608 | -₹4,392 | Freeze dining/drinks/events; home meals only. |
| Growth Buffer (5%) | ₹7,500 | ₹10,152 | +₹2,652 | Hold for emergencies; no new courses/gadgets. |

## Line-by-Line Adjustments
- **Dining/Drinks**: Hard cap ₹3,000 for remainder of Nov. Log each entry; if cap hit, switch to home cooking.
- **Healthcare/Supps**: Move optional items (non-prescription) to December. For necessary treatments, route through Needs bucket and note receipts.
- **Subscriptions & OTT**: Cancel/ pause duplicates (Comic Con done, keep max 2 OTT). Target ₹2,000 monthly within Lifestyle.
- **Transfers**: Next Siddhu transfer capped at ₹15k (down from ₹25k) unless surplus appears.

## Daily Actions
1. After each spend, drop it into Finance Daily Ledger with bucket tag.
2. Every Sunday: sum each bucket; if ≥75% of cap, enforce spending freeze (Needs and Lifestyle already in freeze).
3. Record any deviations in the ledger with `#review` for Blackrock follow-up.

## End-of-Month Goals
- Restore savings rate ≥35%.
- Keep Lifestyle bucket ≤₹40.6k.
- Maintain at least ₹10k cash cushion heading into December.

> Stick this plan near the Daily Ledger; it’s the simplified guardrail while Gravl/YNAB hold the raw data.
