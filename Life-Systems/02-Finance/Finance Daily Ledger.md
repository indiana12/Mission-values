# Finance Daily Ledger

Use this rolling table to paste daily inflows/outflows. Tag each entry with the **Blackrock bucket** so the agent can check caps (Needs 45%, Goals 30%, Lifestyle 20%, Growth 5% of income).

| Date | Category | Bucket | Amount (₹) | Payment Method | Notes | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
