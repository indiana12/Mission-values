# Budget Analysis Framework

Use this checklist whenever you run a new YNAB export. Populate each section in a dated analysis note (e.g., [[Life-Systems/02-Finance/Budget Analysis - 2025-11-11|Budget Analysis — 11 Nov 2025]]).

## 1. Income Map
- List each source (salary, rent, transfers, adjustments).
- Classify as recurring vs. one-off.
- Track three-month moving average and variance (%).

| Source | Current | 3-M Avg | Δ | Recurring? | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |

## 2. Expense Tree
- Organize spend into buckets (Needs, Goals, Lifestyle, Growth).
- For each category, capture:
  - Current spend
  - Trend (vs. previous snapshot)
  - Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Trigger (need, habit, impulse)

| Category | Bucket | Current | Δ vs. prior | Frequency | Trigger |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |

## 3. Pattern Flags
- Identify top 3 rising categories and root causes (seasonal, habit, one-off).
- Identify top 3 opportunity cuts and feasibility (easy / moderate / hard).
- Note any overlapping subscriptions or double billing.

## 4. Cash Flow Markers
- Savings rate (current vs. target).
- Debt payoff progress (planned vs. actual).
- Buffer/cushion: cash on hand vs. monthly expenses.
- Upcoming lumpy expenses (travel, insurance, taxes).

## 5. Visualization Hooks
- Build mini charts (ASCII or spreadsheet) for:
  - Income vs. expenses trend
  - Lifestyle bucket over time
  - Needs vs. cap progress
- Note any anomalies to investigate in next export.

## 6. Action Log
- Each action gets: Owner (you/Blackrock), Deadline, Expected impact.

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Tips
- Keep snapshots comparable (same time window).
- Tag unusual entries in the Daily Ledger with `#review`.
- Archive each analysis note; use this framework to ensure consistency.
