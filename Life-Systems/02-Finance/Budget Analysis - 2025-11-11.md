| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lifestyle (Drinks/Dining + restricted spends) | Social validation + novelty seeking     | High-pressure weeks, weekend outings                    | Pre-commit ₹3k limit before going out; log mood/context after each event. Use Growth buffer only if cap exceeded.                      |
| Healthcare + Supplements                      | Resilience investing + health anxiety   | Body fatigue, rehab focus, winter                       | Split ledger tags into “Prescription/Mandatory” vs “Optional.” Optional purchases require Growth buffer review and cooling-off period. |
| Joyful Living + Subscriptions                 | FOMO, comfort maintenance               | Post-event excitement, creativity hunts                 | Allow max 2 OTT + 1 premium app at a time. State the “job” each service performs before renewing.                                      |
| Money Transfers & Debt                        | Generosity + obligation                 | Requests from friends/family when feeling cash-positive | Add 24-hour pause on transfers >₹10k; evaluate impact on savings rate and future expenses.                                             |
| Essentials (Groceries, transport)             | Stable but reactive to lifestyle spikes | Weekend cheat meals, hydration gaps                     | Stick to weekday restock routine; plan hydration/snack list to avoid impulse buys.                                                     |
