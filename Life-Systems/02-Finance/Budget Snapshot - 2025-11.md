## Actions for Blackrock Agent
1. Maintain running balance of net income and recommend allocation: emergency fund, investments, debt payoff.
2. Track lifestyle categories vs. caps (e.g., Dining < ₹3k, Drinks < ₹2k).
3. Highlight when transfers or credit payments spike beyond averages.

## Blackrock Allocation Rule (45 / 30 / 20 / 5)
| Bucket | % of Income | Amount (₹) | Covers | Cap Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Needs & Essentials | 45% | 89,119 | EMI’s, groceries, utilities, healthcare, swimming | Dining + groceries combined must sit inside this pool. |
| Goals & Obligations | 30% | 59,413 | Debt prepayments, investments, planned transfers | Large support transfers should draw from this bucket. |
| Lifestyle & Joy | 20% | 39,608 | Dining/drinks, joyful living, subscriptions, events | Pause discretionary spend once this hits the cap. |
| Growth Buffer | 5% | 9,902 | Courses, gear upgrades, emergency cushion | Unused amount rolls into Goals bucket monthly. |

**How to use**
1. When logging a transaction in the Daily Ledger, assign it to one of the four buckets.
2. Blackrock tracks cumulative spend per bucket and flags yellow/red when caps are breached.
3. Surplus from Lifestyle or Growth automatically shifts to Goals at month-end to accelerate investments.

> Rationale: Income is ~₹1.98L with ~55% current spend. This rule locks 30% toward future goals while containing lifestyle to 20% and keeping a 5% shock absorber.
