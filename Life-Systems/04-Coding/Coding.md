# Coding

[[Life-Systems/Life Systems Hub|← Life Systems Hub]]

## Purpose
Advance technical mastery while shipping reliable software and automations.

## Active Workflows
- **Learning Sprints** — outline curricula, checkpoints, and spaced repetition prompts.
- **Project Pipeline** — define scopes, milestones, and retrospectives.
- **Toolkit Library** — collect snippets, CLI commands, and environment setup notes.

## Suggested Notes
- `Coding - Learning Path`
- `Coding - Project Tracker`
- `Coding - Snippet Vault`

Keep new engineering notes tagged `life/coding` so the graph colours this branch consistently.
